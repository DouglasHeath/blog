							<p>Oh how the time is speeding towards that plane ticket I recently purchased.

                            <p>So the great thing about the people in my life here has been just the sheer amount of fun and random things that happen. Lindsay wanted to hit up Glady's once again before I take off (and before she flew out to LA for a little holiday sun) and I was defintely in for that! Painkillers. Oh those <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Painkiller_(cocktail)" target="_blank">PAINKILLERS!</a> SUCH a fantastic drink and Glady's makes a strong one. So let's have two of those with the jerked fried wings, the plantains, and the jerked pork hash.</p>
                            
                            <p>So after getting a slight giddy in our step, Lindsay and I walked up the street to the Brooklyn Museum. I was so EXCITED to check it out since I run by it like EVERY day I run. Not only was the building beautiful on the inside but they had such a fun variety of exhibits and pieces being shown: Bronze casts of some of Rodin's works, Judy Chicago's big piece <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dinner_Party" target="_blank"><i>The Dinner Party</i></a>, and a big exhibit of mummified animals from mostly Ancient Egyptian times. </p>
                            <p>The Judy Chicago piece was a collaboration of mutliple artists working with Judy back in the 70's, celebrating the lives of powerful and influential women throughout herstory. </p>

                            <p>So Lindsay has been helping me with a running plan since I've expressed an interest in training for a half marathon. I've been doing the standard <i>"I'll just go out and run with no plan or idea what the hell I'm doing"</i> approach so far. To which she snickered and offered the simple suggestion of switching up the workout so I don't hurt myself. So I did two days last week of some speed work; 5 minutes at a slow 9 minute mile pace followed by 1 minute of a mid/standard 8 minute mile pace, and finishing with a 30 second sprint/explosive pace. Do that 5 times. Ugh... My body was not ok with this sudden changing of the program but I pushed through it, demanding it listen to the heart/brain and not the lactic acid. So yeah, woke up this morning and thought, <i>"I'm going to do a slow day so I can get some distance."</i> That turned into my furthest distance so far; <strong>10 MILES!</strong> And I felt GREAT afterwards. I mean I'm not turning around and doin' that tomorrow but the switch up had very noticeable effects almost immediately. Which gives me confidence that I can do a half fairly easily. Now to do it competetively? That'll take some <i>actual</i> training but I'm going to bask in this feeling of smashing my previous plateau for the first time in my many, MANY years of running.</p>
                            
							<p>I had a former manager reach out to me last week wanting to mentor/guide me through this transitional period and we're meeting for some coffee the week after I get back. I'm so grateful once again for the network I have back in Seattle. I think if I can put a bit under the belt and get that foot in the door, the rest will naturally just start falling into place. I mean, I can't rely on Toyota commercials for the rest fo my life now, can I? I'd most likely have to supplement them with some Lexus commercials as well. ðŸ˜‰</p>
                            
                            <p>It's Christmas Eve and I've got to get downstairs to start the festivities since the ladies are coming over for some of (apparently) <i>"the most amazing short ribs you'll ever eat</i>, made by Danielle. Lots of of other fun eatings on the menu and plenty of German white, courtesy of yours truly. It'll help with making my thighs happy... MERRY CHRISTMAS EVERYONE! I love you all!</p>

							<p>Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar.

When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a last view back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane.
