                            <p>It is most likely fitting that I listen to the foreboding sounds of Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross on their absolutely gorgeous yet haunting soundtrack they did for David Fincher's take on <i>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.</i> I only say that because it is Dark O'Clock on a Saturday evening and the view outside yields fresh snow. Somewhat fresh. I mean, it has been steadily coming down <i>all</i> day. While beautiful, I still can't help myself from going into that thought of <i>"is this a harbringer of something bigger aroudn the corner?"</i> I blame Trent, Atticus, and the gin. </p>
                            
                            <p>So, Job Hunt 2017, soon to spill into 2018. What can I say? I'm trying to keep this chin up but I'm thinking I came to New York at the wrong time of the year for job searching. No, no I didn't. I came at <i>precisely</i> the right time. I'm deciding to put the positivity out there, not the doubt. So where do I stand? Well, Danielle had mentioned a friend of hers who just got hired with a custom/bespoke lighting company in Soho and suggested I apply for a position there. Which I did. Her friend responded right away to my application, led me to an online assesment test (to determine if I'm capable) and had me schedule a phone screen. I spoke with him Friday afternoon and felt it went well! Then again, the last three phone chats I had I've felt went well and they all turned up bumpkiss. As Andrea and Lauren both told me, it's all about managing expectations, or, learning to not be disappointed until you sign the damn papers. *sigh* I'm still holding out hope. </p>

                            <p>Not much else really to talk about except a new series Danielle and I started on Netflix. It is titled <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/1/16724852/netflix-dark-review-first-german-streaming-series" target="_blank">Dark</a> and I have to say, its a bit addictive. Think of a mix of <i>Stranger Things</i> and <i>True Detective</i> Season 1 (not that Season 2 mess). It is a German show so it is redubbed for English audiences but they should have let actually Americans read the dialogue. The translations are fine enough, they just sound like someone who doesn't speak American English. Conversationally it sounds a bit strange. But that's a nit-pick.</p>
                            
                            <p>Friday night, Danielle and I made tacos and drank some wine. Not a typical comfort food but that meal did so much to quench some deep seeded memories that both of us hold onto. Something about that cheap taco seasoning mix that brough us both back to great moments of younger days gone by.</p>
                            
                            <p>Shuffled around in the snow a bit this afternoon and I'm thiking I should have checked a larger suitcase. I'm maintianing right now but HOLY COW I NEED NEW OUTFITS! *sigh* First world problems, I know, and after this shitty week of our inept leadership and So Cal completely being decimated, I can't really complain about <i>anything</i>. Wish I had more for y'all...</p>

							<p>Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar. The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text didn’t listen. </p>

							<p>She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and made herself on the way. When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a last view back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane. Pityful a rethoric question ran over her cheek, then she continued her way.</p>

							<p>Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large <a href="#">language</a> ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth.</p>
