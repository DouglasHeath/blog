							<p>FIRST WEEK DOWN! Working 40 hours that is. There were some real snoozers of days during this past week for sure. There were also some great laughs and a chance to meet some new people both to me and to New York. In fact, one of them reminded me that I should think about getting some new cards made up to hand out. ü§î</p>

							<p>Its now Saturday morning and yo're probably thinking "What HAPPENED in the last 5 days!?" Well friends, sadly nothing truly worth noting. Life as normal. Which begs the question; do I update this thing daily no matter how mundane and trivial my experiences or do I wait to only post things when they have a larger impact? I can't believe you'd want to read "walked to the store, got some pasta sauce, the end" <i>every</i> day. I mean, I don't get pasta sauce <i>every</i> day so I'd think it'd be a tad more thrilling than that but honestly after the week I just experienced, there really isn't much more I <i>could</i> write.</p>

							<p>I can say that there is a recurring theme; I don't seem to get much more than 5 hours of sleep each night. For the last two weeks I've been here. I blame a combination of too much coffee in the afternoon, a bit too much alchohol too late in the evening, and the fact that I <i>am</i> living in the city that never sleeps. I think there is this underlying "pulse" here in New York that I'm picking up subconciously while sleeping. It isn't like I wake up at 4:30AM all groggy and confused rather, I wake up at 4:30AM CHARGED UP and ready to tackle the day.</p>
                            
                            <p>Okay, I did sleep in this morning (it is 7:24AM as of right this moment) and I think a lot of it had to do with the loss of having to make sure I had time to get ready for my day at the office. I can't believe I just wrote that; my day at the office. üòÇ Knowing that my day is wide open led to me finally enjoying a full 7 hours. And I feel GREAT! Today's agenda includes having a run to the park since Apple's giving out a virtual achievement for working out on Veteran's Day. And you are welcome and I also thank all of YOU who served.</p>
                            
                            <p>Sounds like Danielle and I might be hanging out with her friends later this evening. Possible dancing? I dunno. Brunch tomorrow with S and L. Then meeting up with Andrea since she's throwing out some preposterous claim that she <i>might</i> have procured a pony for me. Yeah, I thought the SAME thing so of COURSE I have to see what this girl's up to. Considering she went to MIT I think this might be one of the best pranks I've ever been a victim of. I did tell her I'd probably board a pony down in Prospect Park but with the weather turning, that'd just be animal cruelty.</p>
                            
                            <p>Oh, forgot to mention the weather. While I don't have snow <i>*cough* Kristyn and Pink Esper *cough*</i> you will all be happy to know that the weather went from like 58 to 31 <i>literally</i> overnight. I'm so glad that I brought my smart wool base layers. Next will be some leather gloves. </p>
                            
                            <p>BIG Happy Birthdays to my sister Kristyn and my brother Josh. Kristyn <i>finally</i> made it into the 40's club. WAIT, I MEAN Kristyn will NEVER make it into the 40's club. I love you both and am glad to have you in my life through all of the ups and downs. With ALL of us, AMIRITE!? üéÅüéàüéÇ</p><br><br>
