							<p>So Andrea reached out to some former coworkers and friends putting some feelers out for potential job leads and she was able to get me a phone interview. Granted its only a temporary position doing some data analysis and pulling select info from database dumps but it sounds pretty similar to what I had been doing at KBCS. Phone interview went great, gave me an example Excel assignment (test) and three days to work on it. Finished it in one. They've set up a video interview with the hiring manager for Friday so fingers crossed! Again, it sounds like some temporary work through mid January but there is a potential for longer term if they have work, they like me, yadda yadda. Regardless, I expressed that just getting a foot in the door and some digital media data anaylsis experience will boost my resume.  </p>

							<p>Like the old idom states, "when it rains, it pours", and today was no exception; two weeks of radio silence from job leads and then 3 people reached out requesting a good time to speak with them about potential opportunities. I'm learning to manage my expectations so I'll reserve my celebration until <i>after</i> I sign some onboarding papers. Not to sound like a skeptical New Yorker but when in New York... </p>
                            
                            <p>Today's blog picture is of leaving a temp job and being greeted by New York's finest downstairs. I should back up; Got a temp gig working for a equity firm near Saks Fifth Avenue (yeah, name drop) which involved a lot of digging through old files, cataloging, and boxing them up for transport to their new offices. Not glamorous <i>or</i> well paying but that's not the point. Towards the end of the day I notice that an alarm has been going off for a good 15 minutes. It's muffled so I start to think, "It sure is amazing that I can hear a car alarm ALL the way up on the 14th floor!" I take the elevator down to the lobby, turn the corner, and find the aforementioned gentlemen and what appears to be EVERYONE from the 35 floor office building congregating in the entryway. I'm still not sure if it was a drill or not but I can <i>definitely</i> say that there hasn't been a dull moment in any of these temp gigs so far.</p>

							<p>Went over to Lauren and Sarah's for our first (finally) chance at starting Cage Rage Night. Lauren cooked a taco soup (NOM NOM) and I provided some blackberry margaritas. Poor Sarah was reeling from a back injury that had her seeking relief from some muscle relaxers and couch rest. Yams was excited to see me and didn't bite my feet for a change! </p>
                            
                            <p>We decided to watch one of Nick Cage's strangest movies, <i>Vampire's Kiss.</i> Oh... Em... Eff... Absolutely ridiculous in that Nick Cage tries to do this weird half-British accent that he keeps dropping in and out of, sometimes in the middle of a word. The premise (I'll try not to spoil the movie but come on... you don't want/need to watch <i>this</i> movie) is that Nick Cage is a New York playboy/womanizer who meets a one night stand that happens to be a vampire. He gets bit and that's when it goes off the rails. I can't even start. We're pretty sure that most of the dialogue was ad-libbed by Nick and it is <i>classic</i> (bad) Cage. But that is what Cage Rage Night is for; terrible Nick Cage. We thought about <i>Family Man</i> but that movie is sweet and touching and NOT what the night is about. We want to scream with delight in how terrible his acting can be and scream we did. </p>
                            
                            <p>I'll do my best to update this weekend after Friday's interview goes. Maybe I'll <i>finally</i> be able to post that picture of toasting champagne glasses I got from <a href="http://www.gettyimages.com" target="_blank">Getty.</a></p>

							<p>Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar. The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text didn‚Äôt listen. </p>

							<p>She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and made herself on the way. When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a last view back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane. Pityful a rethoric question ran over her cheek, then she continued her way.</p>

							<p>Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large <a href="#">language</a> ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth.</p>
