							<p>Another Monday, and it came way too early for the weekend I spent. Where do I begin?</p>

							<p>Friday night I ended up over near Fort Greene Park and had some Negronis in the back of <a href="http://walterfoods.com/walters/" target="_blank">Walter's</a> at some Japanese restaruant called <a href="http://www.karasubk.com" target="_blank">Karasu</a>. DELICIOUS. AND the place just happened to be one I was familiar with since the ladies and I had our "Fancy Night" there during the inaugural Tschüssfest back in September. <i>They call him Westy, or maybe Holden, but I don't know that, because I stole him. That's not my dog... That's not my dog... That's not my dog... That's not my.... dog.</i></p>
                            <p></p>
                            <div class="col-lg-4 animate-box">

								    <h4>TL;DR</h4>
								    <p>I'm living in a movie...</p>
							     </div>
						    </div>

							<p>Saturday I FINALLY had some down time and took advantage of it by not doing A DAMN THING! No, I did stuff. Washed a bunch of clothes (all that cold calling got me sweaty), went for a run, and then walked a fairly decent distance all thay way back across Atlantic Ave in order to source some decent wine for the dinner party Danielle was having that evening. You see, New York is like Washington USED to be, where you can't buy wine or alcohol in the super market. You have to find an <i>actual</i> shop. And I certainly was not going to buy some "hooch" at one of the convenient corner bodega-like liquor shop that has bullet proof glass surrounding the clerk. Don't think the viognier is going to be up to snuff.</p>
                            
                            <p>Danielle ends up <a href="https://www.marthastewart.com/891288/how-spatchcock-chicken" target="_blank">spatchcocking</a> some chicken and squash and I find myself in the midst of some true culinary prowess. With Sarah, Mari and her mom, myself and Danielle enjoying the spoils of some fine wine, delicious dinner, and hearty laughter, we go well into Sunday morning with smiles on our faces. And late night espressos. And the headaches that come first thing in the morning...</p>
                            
                            <p>Sunday was the marathon and while I was curious to be up close to the course, I also thoroughly enjoy any day that Prospect Park is quiet since it lends great power to my meditation, even if my meditation is sweating my ass off trying to complete a double lap (I will get there). Little bit of misty rain, perfect temperature, lots of Arcade Fire in the ear. </p>

                            <p>Meet up with Lindsay for some oyster happy hour which ends up being a complete BUST since the place I chose <i>lied</i> about the times for HH on a Sunday. Whatever. We head over to the Alamo Drafthouse to take in a movie and are presented with the most powerfully difficult yet cinematically beautiful movie I think I've ever seen: Yorgos Lanthimos' <i>The Killing of a Sacred Deer</i>. Seriously, if you haven't see <i>The Lobster</i> or <i>Dogtooth</i>, do yourself a favor and watch one of these three. Or not. I'm still reeling from how absolutely difficult and horrible the premise is. Two of us in the theatre clapped but judging by the extremely soft murmur as the credits rolled, I wasn't the only one left haunted by this film. Lindsay and I didn't say much to each other afterwards...</p>
