							<p>8AM came REALLY early for some reason. Maybe it's the jet lag? Pacific Standard Time affinity? Bah. Nothing some delicious pour over can't remedy (thanks again, Sarah!). After a wonderful evening with Sarah, Lauren, and Danielle, we retired to Bed-Stuy for some good ol' Cage Rage therapy. Last night's classic? The Rock. Unfortunately Lauren and I forgot how much paperwork and bureaucracy precedes the EPIC Alcatraz showdown, much to Sarah's chagrin. Sarah's also convinced that Michael Bay purposely wrote as many 's' words he could just so Sean Connery could speak with that SHHHcotish ACSHHHent.</p>

							<p>Headed into Manhattan today for two first step meetings with a pair of marketing firms. What do I know about marketing? ZIP. But I am good with people so maybe that translates? First interview was 'meh'. Second was much more relaxed although they both followed that East Coast format; FAST and FURIOUS. Seriously, 3 minutes each. At least I ate an overpriced spice chicken wrap.</p>

							<p>Rode the subway back to S and L's place to check in on Yams (their sweet kitty) and to take off the monkey suit. I should hear back from both companies tonight whether or not I make the cut. Maybe grab a drink with Karen? Regardless, first day going well, don't worry about me, mom! ðŸ˜‰ </p>

Guess I still know how to charm... ðŸ˜‰ Looks like I'm headed back into Manhattan on Friday so I'm hoping this weather stays the way it is. A bit grey and drab with bits of sun breaks here and there. And why did I wait until AFTER summer? </p>
                            
                            <p>Walked down to a local grocery store, grabbed some necessary items. The sights and sounds of Brooklyn around me giving me a welcome. Can't quite say if it is a warm welcome but a welcome nonetheless. </p>

							<p>Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar. The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text didnâ€™t listen. </p>

							<p>She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and made herself on the way. When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a last view back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane. Pityful a rethoric question ran over her cheek, then she continued her way.</p>

							<p>Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large <a href="#">language</a> ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth.</p>
