                            <p>What can I say? What else can I do? I've given this a shot, thought "hey, I'm a grown-ass man, how hard can it be?" Well, those of you who still might be reading, pretty difficult is the answer you're looking for. I think the combination of the holidays and not having a previous background in the coporate world has made the search <i>really</i> hard. Well, maybe my pride has a bit to do with it as well since I've put myself in the difficult place because I refused to go back to restaurant work. So I'm left in this limbo of feeling unemployable, missing my support group, and wondering if it was worth the bother?</p>

                            <p>Firstly; DEFINITELY WORTH THE BOTHER! As most of you know, the past year and a half of my life has been the biggest trial I've ever faced. So there was a LOT of trepidation surrounding this decision to move out here but I had lots of people tell me that I should do it regardless and I agreed. I can say that this move out here was <i>completely</i> out of left field for my usual M.O. and that excited the hell out of me. It also scared the hell out of me but the excitement won out. And New York City did not disappoint. I've had an absolute blast while I've been out here. But the doubt crept back in and the lack of work makes it pretty clear that I should have waited to try this at a better time of the year, job wise.</p>
                            
                            <p>And therein lies the rub; Had I "waited" until the "right" time to move out here, I most likely would not have done it. But isn't that what life is? A series of "should I or shouldn't I" choices that we either spend too much time weighing or brashly give a middle finger to and dive headfirst. This time I opted for diving in and don't regret that decision, even if the pool didn't have quite enough water.</p>

                            <p>So now I'm left holding a hand that isn't strong enough to win the pot and I can't bluff my way out. So I'm folding. I've been writing this post for a few moments now and once it's finished, I'm heading over to Delta to buy a ticket back. I pains me to type that but I also now realize that I left a very strong support system to attempt this and at this point in my life, I need the support more than the independence. </p>
                            
                            <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I purchased a ticket to return to Seattle on the 6th of January. I originally thought it would be the Friday but I was too slow on the click so I pushed it to Saturday instead. </p>
                            
                            <p>So, is this blog done? No, far from it. I'm still going to #liveyourtschüss every day. Just because I'm heading back west doesn't mean I'm going to stop having adventures. In fact, most of my wonderful adventures have happened out west. This means I'll just have to spend a <i>little more</i> money to have pizza at Emily. 😊 </p>

							<p>Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar. The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text didn’t listen. </p>

							<p>She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and made herself on the way. When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a last view back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane. Pityful a rethoric question ran over her cheek, then she continued her way.</p>

Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large <a href="#">language</a> ocean.
