							<p><strong>SATURDAY: </strong>Rode the train out to Queens to meet up with Andrea since she had won some tickets through her work to see a show in Newark. The show? <i>SAD! A Happy Evening</i> with Stephen Colbert and Samantha Bee. Yeah, they were part of a fundraising event put on by Montclair Film and it was GLORIOUS! Basically, Stephen and Samantha sat on stage and had a conversation about her career, motherhood, politics, and the current state of disarray this country is in. A wonderfully candid and humorous event in which they chatted for about an hour and a half and then opened the floor for questions from the audience. Quite a journey to get to Newark and this past weekend, MTA did its best to make sure we wouldn't make it out there. Gotta love the transit here. Sometimes its the best invention since sliced bread and other times its the worst invention since slice bread. I think the locals call it "getting New Yorked". </p>

							<p><strong>SUNDAY: </strong>Sat around most of the day watching documentaries and making fried rice. Yeah. Fried Rice. I'm pretty effing good at it. My recipe is frying up some garlic and onions in canola/vegetable oil with a small amount of sesame oil. You can put sesame seeds in there but the oil gives it that little kick. Add some frozen peas and carrots, and I added some chicken and smoked almond pieces. Push it all to the side while you fry a couple of eggs in there. Put a fair amount of soy sauce (tamari for my GF friends) and toss all the mixture together to get it nice and coated. Then stir in some jasmine rice. NOM NOM. Sure, its not as glamourous or <i>as</i> tasty as a restaurant's but it suites my taste (literally) and is pretty cheap to make large amounts. </p>
                            
                            <p>Totally forgot about the supermoon but happened to catch a bit of it above the line of houses across the street. Tried my best to capture it (*SPOILER ALERT* I didn't) and that's what this post's banner picture is. By the time I saw it (Approximately 8:30pm EST), it was more of a harvest moon, with a pumpkin-y orange and a size more akin to a "run-of-the-mill moon" (<i>Confidential to the moon: You're always "super" in my eyes).</i> With the slight bit of clouds and foggy air, I thought the moon had somehow transported me back to Halloween. </p>

							<p><strong>MONDAY: </strong> Well the day has started out pretty unremarkable with one caveat: I <i>finally</i> broke the 6 mile mark I've been chasing. I slowed the pace down in order to catch it and was completely shocked to see that I STILL had averaged a 7'37" mile. Apparently I can't run slow. Maybe I should listen to different music? Regardless, I feel <i>amazing</i> right now and happy that the weather has been so mild here to encourage me to keep running. Seriously, if it wants to stay in the mid to high 40's during the day with sunshine in the skies, BRING IT! Followed the usual route down to Prospect but have been starting to run on the outer path outside of the actual park, since that route is a bit farther. It isn't as pleasant of a route since I'm right next to the street and the distance isn't <i>too</i> much further than running on the inside so, wait, why the hell am I doing that route then? ü§î</p>
                            
                            <p>OH! I almost forgot; So Friday's interview went really well. Had a Google Meeting chat with two of the team members looking to pull in some temp help for the next month. Quick run down; they have been aquired by another company and are making the hand-off but lost a couple of their digital RevOps people to other companies. They need a couple of people to come in and help out with filing the holes left by the previous people. It would be a lot of data entry, retrieval, and analysis and super similar to what I did for KBCS. About a half hour conversation with the three of us and I felt confident after it was done. They told me they had one more candidate to speak with today so I should know by tomorrow whether or not this pans out. Yeah, I know it isn't "I GOT A JOB" but it'll come. </p>
                            
                            <p>If anything exciting happens later today, I'll update. It's only 10:40am here so, cut me some slack.</p>
                            <p><strong>BIG BIRTHDAY SHOUTOUT</strong> to my neice, Maiya! 19 today. Wow. You're an amazing woman with such creative ideas. Oh and heard you got a car! I know who's chauffering me around when I back in the PNDub. I love you, kiddo!</p>

							<p>Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar. The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text didn‚Äôt listen. </p>

							<p>She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and made herself on the way. When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a last view back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane. Pityful a rethoric question ran over her cheek, then she continued her way.</p>

							<p>Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large <a href="#">language</a> ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth.</p>
