							<p>Slept like garbage the night before so getting up was a bit more difficult than I would've liked this morning. Plus, I think my body was not looking forward to running another 3 miles after getting up to 5.25 the night before. I've been at this plateau for a few months where I haven't been able to break the 4.5 mark on my runs. For some reason, I broke that last night and felt <i>amazing</i> afterwards. I think it's a direct correlation to the amount of eggnog being consumed. Regardless the reason, I needed to earn that Apple acheivement badge for Turkey Day. It's like Pokémon only healthier! Ran down to the Grand Army Plaza, looped around, and headed home. 3.2 miles and badge earned. Soak in all its digital glory!</p>

							<p>Helped Danielle prep the downstairs AirBnB for some new guests coming and then spent the rest of the late morning/early afternoon joking with Sarah and Lauren while we all prepped our chosen potluck dishes. Lauren cooked an <i>incredible</i> turkey, Sarah made some delcious and creamy mashed potatoes, and I made a couple of tins of green bean casserole. I think the shallots, worchestershire, and garlic I threw into the mix helped make them pop. Plenty of eggnog and bourbon to be had (I thought about us, Dad) and eventually our friends started to arrive.</p>

							<p>Copious amounts of wine and a turkey dinner fit for royalty was presented around 6pm. Only a few hours after we thought we were to eat but I guess good things come to those who wait and this was no exception to that. I'm always eating way too much and I didn't disappoint myself this year either. One of these Thanksgiving days I will actually commit to having one nice sized plate and call it. </p>
                            
                            <p>After a laugh filled evening, most everyone left or went to bed. Lauren and I watched a few episodes of a couple of different shows before she finally called a Lyft and took her and Sarah back to Bed-Stuy. I spent another hour cleaning up downstairs before finally trudging upstairs and passing out. Overall, an amazing day and it is only one of the <i>many</i> things I was so grateful and thankful for. Happy Thanksgiving everyone!</p>

							<p>Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar. The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text didn’t listen. </p>

							<p>She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and made herself on the way. When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a last view back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane. Pityful a rethoric question ran over her cheek, then she continued her way.</p>

							<p>Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large <a href="#">language</a> ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth.</p>
