							<p>Well, two days unaccounted for. I meant you, not me. I remember everything! Nothing too exciting to report. Saturday was a GORGEOUS day here in Brooklyn. Ran around Proepect Park again, SUPER crowded but MAN if it wasn't warm and felt like tail end of Summer, certainly not Fall. Two slices of Rocco's $1 cheese pizza and some really bad Netflix movies. Then Sunday came. HA! Went from mid 60's to low 50's and HEAVY rains. I'm pretty sure Brooklyn thought I'd appreciate having a little bit of Seattle weather so that I could <i>acclimate.</i> I'll give New York that one although the skeptic in me is still waiting for her to pull that rug out from under me. At least that's what everyone I've encountered tells me to prepare for; she's a cruel bitch at times but she'll also make you feel like the king of the world.</p>

							<p>Took a Lyft in the sideways rain down to Carrol Gardens for some Prime Meats action; Waygu Beef Tartare, oysters, and a pretzle. Toatal Bavarian thing going on and I will definitely be back for the schnitzel and spaetzle. Their take on a Mint Julep was to die for. SO minty and so sweet. Ended the evening having macchiatos with Cardamaro. An old favorite. AND I think I got Lindsay to change her mind on amaro. The only problem with having some drinks and oysters with someone into the same things as me is that I had to pull the gentleman card and let her enjoy the odd numbered creamy oysters. Shouldn't have told her I liked Shigokus and Kumamotos since I think we'll be fighting over those from here on out.</p>

							<p>Had an interview in Manhattan with a staffing company and Heather sounds pretty confident she can get me placed into a good fit persuing onboarding. So three trips into Manhattan now and I'm getting pretty good at the transit. Man it is SO nice to be in a city that <i>actually</i> had the forethought to build some damn transit (stink eye at you, Seattle). Kind of cold this morning, certainly felt like we're pushing November but once I returned to Brooklyn? Sunny and warm again. Lindsay tells me I've got a few weeks before the shit hits the fan. Get that rainshell here, Zappos!</p>
                            
                            <p>Lauren gets back from Austin tonight and I'll be glad to have some laughs with her. That's if she isn't worn out from flying. Sarah sounded pretty bummed that they left the day after I arrived but I've actually like having some personal time to figure this out; I'm getting pretty good with navigating and getting my bearings when out and about. Sent them a picture of the Caribbean place they took me to last time. A great joint called Glady's. The spiced chicken wings are NOM NOM but I'll pass on the goat stew next time. All the bones turned me off texturally which got me thinking about Mom's little Nigerian goats and it was too much. It's cool, there are SO many other delcious things to eat at Glady's. And drink ðŸ˜‰. I'll need to remember to have Shazzam fired up next time since the reggae they were jamming to was DOPE!</p>
